Hi. My name is Salma and I am currently working as a software engineer focused on Platform (backend) and MLOps. My background includes applied research in deep learning in the domain of cell segmentation at [Carnegie Mellon](https://xulabs.github.io/), privacy-preserving ML at [OpenMined](https://openmined.org/) and graph neural networks at [PathCheck](https://www.pathcheck.org/). I worked as a software engineer at [Microsoft](https://apps.microsoft.com/home) focusing on natural language intent integration for enhancing Store catalog categorization across Apps and Games collections. My interests span representation learning in vision with self/weak supervision, human-AI interaction, neuro-symbolic approaches and compilers.

Over the years, I have worked in machine learning and perception engineering at 5+ AI-first startups across healthcare, autonomous agrobotics, and developer tooling.  Always up to chat on diffusion models, health informatics, worldbuilding, transhumanism, literature and any boisterous builder ideas!
